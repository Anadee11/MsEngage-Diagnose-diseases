# Face Recognition Challenge
## Diagnose Diseases
This is a Malaria Detection model that helps us to easily detect an infected person. With the help of deep learning, it is possible that we upload an image and a result is produced if there exists an infection or not.

# Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Google Drive

1. Google Drive Link - 
- Note : (This GitHub Repository cannot hold whole of the Model because of the large size, even after compressing it cannot be pushed. This drive link contains all the material required, download it to start setting up of the model.
2. Ensure that Python and Pip are installed in the system. You will need to install Tensorflow, Numpy and Cv2 to run the model.
3. Create a virtual environment with help of [Python Virtual Environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
4. Run the command below and here comes the localhost with the flask app.

   ```shell
   python app.py
   ```
- [ ] You have successfully setup the project, now upload an image to get a meaningful result. You can easily test the model now!
